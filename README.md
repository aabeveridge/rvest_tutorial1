# Introductory Web Scraping Tutorial for [IAL 620] Text Mining and Natural Language Processing
This tutorial provides a basic introduction to web scraping. Students learn how to use the Rvest package. Specifically, students learn how to write an R program that selects a particular "home" page URL for a news or blog website, scrapes all the article links from the "home" URL, and then navigates to those links to collect all text content from the linked articles.

## Basic Skills
As this is the first tutorial for IAL 620, students may want refresher tutorials on basic skills that are foundational to programming in R:

- Understanding and navigating the terminal: [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
- R style guide for easy-to-read code: [Hadley Wickham Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
- Basic data exploration skills in R: [Exploring Data in R](https://youtu.be/mgslMeYwNmM)

## Rvest Documentation and Tutorials
Below is the documentation for Rvest. Also, in to the live tutorial provided during class, the following supplementary tutorials can provide extra support for this week's workshop:

- [Rvest Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf)
